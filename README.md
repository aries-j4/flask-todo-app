This website has been made using flask module of Python. It helps keep track of a person's todos and provides functionality to update and delete them as per user's requirement.
  
  To make this website I followed along CodeWithHarry's Python Flask Web Development Tutorial. It was a great learning experience and I am thankful to Harry for proving such good quality content to everyone for free.
