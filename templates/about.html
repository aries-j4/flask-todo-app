  <h3>About this website</h3>
  <p>
    This website has been made using flask module of Python. It helps keep track of a person's todos and provides functionality to update and delete them as per user's requirement.

    To make this website I followed along CodeWithHarry's Python Flask Web Development Tutorial.
    It was a great learning experience and I am thankful to Harry for proving such good quality content to everyone for free.
